## What I'm looking for
I'm looking for a team that is a joy to work with on a daily basis.
I thrive in an environment where I can learn lots of new things, and work to make things a little better.
I'd be really jazzed about working at a socially-conscious startup that has a mission I can believe in -
  but really it's about having a team that works together, overcomes challenges together, and grows together.

## Education
* **University of California, Berkeley.**
  Double major in Mathematics (Pure) and Music.
  3.57 UC GPA, 4.0 Mathematics GPA.
  Graduated: December 2009

## Relevant Experience

### Causes.com
Causes is a large-scale Facebook application that connects people to things they care about.
With about 30 million MAUs and a team of only 8 engineers, automation and predictability were mission-critical.

#### Software Engineer
During the first few months, I worked on wishes.causes.com with a team of two other engineers, a designer, and a product lead.
My responsibilities spanned the whole stack:
  provisioning/configuring app machines and database servers,
  writing models,
  integrating with Facebook,
  realizing mockups in html/css,
  and creating nifty UI elements with jQuery.

#### Systems Engineer
Based on the needs of the company and my insatiable curiosity, I decided to pivot to the operations team.
I was responsible for the automation of machine provisioning and configuration, from the initial machine image to the first 200 OK.
This included automation and monitoring of
  remote power-cycle to dhcp/dns to PXE to kickstart to puppet
  and all the way through gem provisioning and deploy.
I eventually also became responsible for managing the configuring the A10 loadbalancers.
I was also responsible for provisioning and configuring a myriad of different internal services, including
  the static assets cluster with a squid reverse-proxy,
  and moving from a single memcache instance to a consistently-hashed cluster using Dalli.

## Technologies

* **I can code in:**
ruby (rails),
javascript (node + browser),
bash,
puppet,
python

* **I have intimate knowledge of:**
puppet,
dns (bind),
dhcp,
A10 loadbalancer configuration,
redis,
nginx,
browser mumbo jumbo (html/css/js/jquery),
rspec

* **I have worked with / configured:**
squid,
memcached,
mysql,
syslog(-ng)

* **I have strong opinions on / have poked around about:**
various nosql solutions (esp. redis and riak),
mcollective

* **I am willing and able to learn about:** anything.  No really, anything at all.

## Code I am proud of
* [iplogic](http://github.com/jayferd/iplogic),
  an IPv4 swiss army chainsaw in ruby.
* [truth](http://github.com/jayferd/truth),
  a library to define and manage truth in a datacenter (WIP).  It's got a sweet declarative ruby DSL.
* [mathquill](http://mathquill.com),
  gui editable math in the browser.  Also, awesomesauce.
* [rpgem](https://github.com/jayferd/rpgem),
  an admittedly hacky cli tool to turn gems into binary rpms,
  with specified exterrnal dependencies,
  and no dependencies on a compiler, development headers, or development gems.

## Non-sequitur interests
* Rock piano.  Yeah, you heard me.
* Nonviolence and conflict resolution
* Meditation as a means to growth
* Collecting and identifying wild mushrooms
* Skipping
